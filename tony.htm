      <p> Drums/backup vocals</p>
      <p> At a very young age I was inspired to play the drums from the "Little 
        Drummer Boy" Christmas cartoon. I headed straight for the band room in 
        my grade school! There was a very supportive drum teacher in the school 
        band that taught me to never give up and practice always pays off. I continued 
        to play through grade school and in Jr. High. I will never forget that 
        Christmas morning when my parents "oops Santa clause" had a red sparkle 
        CB 700 drum set, I knew where I belonged. Neighborhood musicians inspired 
        my style of singing and drumming such as: my sister Marie Mucci, SLD band, 
        Pete Corona and Rudy Sabatini. I have very loving and supportive family 
        and friends. I have always had a faith through God, but not until 10 years 
        ago did I truly understand why we are on this place they call earth. Only 
        a year ago did I learn what path the Lord has chosen for me. I have been 
        watching my younger brother progress rapidly in his musical talents. I 
        told him now all we have to do is pray for a singer and a guitar player. 
        *warning: Be careful of what you pray for. You may just get it. The Lord 
        sent a very quiet musician named Robbie. He came over to our house where 
        Jason and I would practice. I could hardly believe the sound the very 
        first time we sat down to play. We continued writing and playing songs 
        inspired by the Lord for about a year, and before we realized it we were 
        Verse: 3. I hope you enjoy the musical message we have to offer. God has 
        a plan. </p>
