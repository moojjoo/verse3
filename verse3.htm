        <p align="center" <font color="#606060">V  E  R  S  E  : 3</p><br>

<p>V  E  R  S  E  : 3 is an Alternative Christian Band out of Charlotte, NC.<br><br> 
   V  E  R  S  E  : 3 has been writing, arranging, practicing and performing their music together for over 3 years, in multiple venues and as far from home as New York.<br><br> 
   V  E  R  S  E  : 3's Alternative style of Christian music brings with it an uplifting, inspiring and most of all, a positive message in an often-negative world. Their music has consistently appealed to adults of all ages as well as the youth of this day.<br><br>
   V  E  R  S  E  : 3's roots are firmly grounded in the Word of God and not in the fame and fortune that the World's idea of success may bring. Just as the great evangelists of times gone by have gone into foreign lands, V  E  R  S  E  : 3 is bringing the message of Salvation to those who would not normally have an opportunity to hear it.<br><br> 
   If V E  R  S  E  : 3 can be used of God, to help just one young person or perhaps a worried parent, to know the comfort and love of God through music and song, then they believe it is but a small sacrifice, compared to the mercy and grace of God, who let his only Son die for our sins, and this is why   V  E  R  S  E  : 3 is truly committed to Do Good Music.<br><br>
   <h1>V  E  R  S  E  : 3 consist of the following:</h1></p>

    <p>Tony Mucci is 34 and originally from Long Island New York. He is an experienced songwriter, lyricist and drummer. He works hard and gives 100% to everything he does. His long time ambition has been to reach the lost of this world through music and ministry. Tony invites you to read more about him on his bio page at: <a href="tony.htm">www.verse3.com/tony.htm</a><br><br>

	Robbie Hegler is 26 years old and is a native of Charlotte, North Carolina. Robbie is an accomplished Guitar player and provides the lead Vocals on most of V  E  R  S  E  : 3's material. Having grown up in a musical and God fearing family, Robbie was inspired to compose and perform music that is both positive and glorifying to God. Robbie invites you to get to know him more by visiting his bio page at:<a href="robbie.htm">www.verse3.com/robbie.htm</a><br><br>

	Jason Mucci is 19. Also from Long Island, New York, Jason moved with his family to the Carolinas at a very young age. Jason credits his love for the Lord and for music to the example he saw in his older brother, Tony. He believes that his relationship with God has grown stronger as he has focused his music toward reaching lost souls for Christ. As well as being the Bass player and back up vocalist, Jason brings with him a truly unique blend of musical style and is responsible for V  E  R  S  E  : 3's fresh new musical flavors that bridge the gaps between both the Christian and the secular world. Jason invites you to get closer to him by reading his bio at:<a href="jason.htm">www.verse3.com/jason.htm</a></p><br><br>
