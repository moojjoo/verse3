      <p><i>Charlotte, NC</i></p>
      <p> Lead vocals/guitar</p>
      <p> Born and raised in Charlotte, N.C. growing up around a family that was 
        musically talented was my greatest influence. My father and middle brother 
        were talented with a guitar. I grew up around gospel and country music, 
        so most of it was played with an acoustic guitar. I picked up the guitar 
        when I was around 9 or 10 years old. My father worked at an Ovation guitar 
        plant so that's what I started playing on. I couldn't read sheet music, 
        so they taught me basic chords like G,C,A,and D. I would usually learn 
        songs by listening to them over and over until I would figure them out. 
        Over time I developed the skill of playing by ear. As I got older I started 
        listening to rock and pop music. I never picked up an electric guitar 
        until I was 24. I just always liked the sound of an acoustic. I started 
        going out to clubs to watching bands play. Ever since then I knew what 
        I wanted to do. I doubted myself and never pushed forward my goals. I 
        had failed. Then one day I gave it all up and realized that I could not 
        do it alone. I became a reborn Christian. Now at the age of 25 I can see 
        that the Lord gave me my talents for his works. He has brought two great 
        people and now close friends into my life. They too had the desire to 
        use their talents. And ever since the three of us have come together to 
        live out our dreams and most important to glorify God. And with the love 
        of our family and friends it's been so great to see that it's all in the 
        Lord's hands. And it's only just begun. </p>
