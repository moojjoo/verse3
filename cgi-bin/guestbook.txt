send me some of Verse 3's 
music though e-mail because i was 
having difficultity downloading 
some of there music. I told my friends 
all about the website and 
they said they would have a look at it 
soon. One of my friends Micheal, 
really liked there music, and he wants 
to know how he can get a copy of 
there ablum without getting it through 
your wedsite(he doesn't think 
putting credit card numbers over the 
internet is safe). Got to go and do 
my homework. Speak to you soon.
