      <h2><i>Long Island, NY</i></h2>
      <p>Bass/Backup Vocals</p>
      <p> I have always been inspired to play. Since an early childhood my brother 
        and I have spent time playing and listening to music together. My first 
        instrument of choice were the drums, but once I saw a crazy bass guitarist 
        named Flea from a band called the Red Hot Chilli Peppers I was hooked. 
        Tony had a great influence on me and it didn't take long before I was 
        performing for him and his friends. As I grew older and with moving to 
        North Carolina I put my music on hold for awhile. My relationship with 
        God has always been there. It may not have been the closest at times but 
        all that changed when Tony moved down here to N.C. Not only did he show 
        me the light, but he awoke my musical calling as well. So, now I mixed 
        the two in my life; the wild crazy bass bangin' guitarist with a positive 
        praise and worship style. Some of the bands I listen to are D.C. Talks, 
        Jars of Clay, P.O.D., Blindside, and of course my all time favorite, hands 
        down the best band ever CREED. They have had a big influence on our sound 
        and it really shows in new song One Last Stand in which I was kinda going 
        for that Creed sound. I have something to say to all you kids my age out 
        there, don't ever believe that you are too young or not good enough to 
        succeed in music. If you have faith you can succeed in anything you do. 
        ROCK ON! </p>
